KS Algorithm:

repeat a finite support signal x many times to be a signal of length N.

this is equavalent to a signal processing recursion loop

y[n] = x[n] + y[n-M] p.s M = len(x)

to implement this in python

for n in range(0, N):

	y[n] = (x[n] if n < M else 0) + (y[n-M] if n-M >= 0 else 0)
    return y
