3.5.a

- DFS is an extension of the DFT f  or periodic sequences.
- A circular time-shift is an natural extension of a shift for finite-length signals.


Summary of Lesson 3.5
The discrete Fourier series is just a different flavour of the DFT applied to periodic series. NN-periodic sequences in the time domain are mapped onto $N$-periodic sequences in the frequency domain. Furthermore, the definition of the DFS retrospectively better justifies the use of circular shifts as the natural extension of shifts for finite-length sequences.

Later in the lesson, we have revisited the Karplus-Strong algorithm to illustrate a key point about the DFS. If we take the DFT of LL repetitions of a finite length sequence of length NN, we obtain a series which is non-zero only at multiple integers of LL. Moreover, these non zero coefficients are just scaled versions of the DFT coefficients of the original finite-length sequence. Therefore, all the spectral information of an NN-periodic sequence is entirely captured by the DFT coefficients of one period.

3.6.DTFT

- the DTFT is a function of real variable omiga.
- the DTFT is 2pi-periodic, hence we write it as a function of e^jw to emphasise this property.
- The product of a complex exponential with a signal creates a shift of its spectrum in the frequency domain.
- DTFT of delta[n] is equal to 1
- DTFT of 1 is a pulse of Diracs centered at 0.

3.7 Sinusoidal modulation

after two times multiply with the carrier signal. the reconstruction in frequency domain has main problem that.
we have only recovered the baseband signal exactly.

but we have some spurious high-frequency components. we need to get rid of them.

- to demodulate the signal modulated with a cosine function of frequency omiga_c, we multiply it by a cosine function of the  same carreir frequency.

- the multiplication of a signal by a cosine of frequency omega_c always creates a signal whose spectrum contains two exact replica of the original spetrum, halved and centered at -omega_c and omega_c, but this is only valide if the carrier frequency omega_c is not too clos to pi.
