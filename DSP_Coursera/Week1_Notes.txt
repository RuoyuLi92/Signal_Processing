signal is vectors embedded in vector space

the recording device will give you unstructured data and there will be no function to describe the phenomenon, that is the problem about analog signals

signal processing is needed since we must take measurement of physical phenomenon, and we lose information

why integers: storage, processing, transmission

transmission TX transmitter use channel and send informations to receiver RX, in the channel there will be noise
先衰减信号，再加上noise。因此如何才能恢复原先的信息呢？	唯一能做的就是乘以衰减系数，如此以来信号中的噪音也被放大了

对于long channel需要经历数次衰减和恢复的过程，因此增加了N次噪音出现的场景。如果使用数字信号。就可以规定明确的信号数量级，去除噪声

periodic signals are natural bridge between finite and infinite lengths.

we can always embedded finite-length signals to infinite-length signals

shift signals : finite support shift (padding 0 before and after finite interval) or periodic extension

Power and Energie: Energie will be infinte for periodic and infinte signal but power is limited
